dht_crawler
===========

a dht crawler using libtorrent

## How to compile
Well, currently all params are hard coded. I'm just testing whether it works fine. Basically, do NOT use it yet.

You will need libtorrent-rasterbar and libboost-all installed in order to compile it. Check the Makefile.

##Working on
Accept command with params (session numbers, torrent limits, result files, etc.)

Save and resume states

Show and save statistics
